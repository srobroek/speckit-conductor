"""Coverage for speckit-tasks-guard.py, which has three roles branched on
the tool: a DENY on writes to specs/*/tasks.md, and advisories on a Bash
command or a Skill invocation that touches the same ground.

The deny is the part worth pinning hardest in both directions. tasks.md is
never authored under the beads workflow, so writing one must be refused with
the replacement workflow in the reason; but a write to any OTHER tasks.md, or
to a spec file that is not tasks.md, is ordinary work and must pass. So must
everything in a repository with no beads workspace.

`bd` is stubbed on PATH so these tests describe the guard's logic rather than
the machine's beads state.

Ported from the retired speckit-beads-tasks-guard.bats; every bats case has a matching
test here.
