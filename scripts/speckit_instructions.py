"""Per-command instructions the SpecKit dispatcher injects.

Data, not logic: the dispatcher resolves a command name and looks it up here. Adding
a command is an edit to this table.

WHY A TABLE RATHER THAN STEERING ALONE. Steering is always-loaded context an agent may
or may not act on; the first end-to-end run of this package read the steering and
still hand-rolled a spec outside the molecule. An instruction attached to the moment a
command fires arrives when the decision is still cheap.

WHAT EARNS AN ENTRY. Only a command where the advice is specific and load-bearing:
where work starts and a pour decision applies, where the command writes an artifact a
guard denies, or where findings have somewhere particular to go. 62 SpecKit skills
install with spec-kit; a generic "you are in a molecule" note on all of them trains an
agent to ignore the channel.

DENY IS THE EXCEPTION. One command is refused outright rather than advised, because
its whole output is a second task tracker.
