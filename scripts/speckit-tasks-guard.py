"""Cross-tool hook with several roles, branched on `tool_name`.

PreToolUse (Write|Edit|MultiEdit|apply_patch): DENY every write to
specs/*/tasks.md when the repo has an active beads workspace. tasks.md is never
authored under the beads workflow -- task state lives in beads. The deny reason
carries the full replacement workflow so the agent self-corrects without a human
(hook-guard policy: deny is agent-facing, never "ask").

PreToolUse (Bash): ADVISORY ONLY -- a command string referencing a
specs/*/tasks.md path gets a non-blocking additionalContext note (task state
lives in beads). No redirect parsing; plain substring match.

PreToolUse (Skill): ADVISORY ONLY -- invoking speckit-implement gets a
non-blocking note that /speckit.implement is deprecated in beads repos; route
through the agent-assign chain instead.

DELIBERATE DESIGN CHOICE, do not change: a bare-string `tool_input` has no path
to judge, so it ALLOWS rather than denying -- the deny needs a specific named
path. This is documented and pinned by
packages/speckit/tests/test_speckit_tasks_guard.py ("string-form tool_input allows").

Self-gating (never rely on the matcher): exits 0 silently when the payload is
empty, `bd` is missing, the target path is not specs/*/tasks.md, or the repo has
no active beads workspace (`bd where` fails).
